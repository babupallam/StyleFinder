You're 99% there â€” this error is simply because **Python canâ€™t find the `backend` module** from the root folder you're running the command in.

Let me walk you through a clean fix 

---

##  Why This Happens

The command:

```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

tells Python to look for a module named `backend` **in the current directory**.

But in your project structure:

```
Final-Msc-Project-Fatima/
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

You're running the command from:
```
Final-Msc-Project-Fatima/
```

So Python **canâ€™t see the `backend` module inside `api/`**.

---

##  Fix: Change into the `api/` directory first

Run these exact commands:

```bash
cd api
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

Now Python can find `backend.main:app`, because `backend/` is inside the current folder (`api/`).

##  Bonus Tip: Quick Test

Once it runs successfully, go to:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

And test the `/api/search` endpoint directly from your browser ðŸŽ‰
