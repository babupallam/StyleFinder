Absolutely — based on your project goals (CLIP-based **image-to-image retrieval**, **text-to-image search**, and general **multimodal re-identification**), here’s a **refined test suite outline** for your `api/tests/` directory. These are adjusted to directly validate core functionalities of your pipeline and deployment:

---

###  `01_test_model_loading.py`
**Purpose**: Ensure all trained CLIP checkpoints (including ViT-B/16, fine-tuned variants) load correctly.

- Test loading original OpenAI CLIP model.
- Test loading Stage 2 fine-tuned image encoder.
- Test loading Stage 3 joint encoder model (`BEST.pth` / `FINAL.pth`).
- Validate presence of expected keys (`model_state_dict`, `train_args`).

---

###  `02_test_feature_extraction.py`
**Purpose**: Verify that features (embeddings) are extractable from images and text.

- Load a sample image → ensure `encode_image()` returns normalized vector.
- Tokenize sample text prompt → verify `encode_text()` returns vector.
- Validate that both produce same-dimensional outputs (e.g., 512-D).
- Check behavior when using augmented or edge-case inputs (blank images, long text).

---

###  `03_test_similarity_search.py`
**Purpose**: Confirm that similarity search returns correct neighbors.

- Given a query image, find top-k closest gallery images using cosine similarity.
- Given a text query prompt, retrieve most similar image embeddings.
- Include test cases using mocked or fixed embeddings for consistent testability.
- Assert that rank-1 match of identical image/text returns highest score.

---

###  `04_test_prompt_alignment.py` **(New)**
**Purpose**: Validate that prompt-to-item identity mapping is consistent.

- For a given `item_id`, load prompt from `image_prompts_per_identity.json`.
- Confirm presence and format (string, max length).
- Check tokenizer compatibility (≤ 77 tokens).
- Optional: Match prompt descriptions with visual features (cosine score threshold).

---

###  `05_test_clip_engine_integration.py` **(New)**
**Purpose**: Integration test of `clip_engine.py` with full inference loop.

- Load model → extract embedding → run search → return top results.
- Validate internal flow: preprocess → tokenize → embed → search.
- Simulate both **image-to-image** and **text-to-image** flows end-to-end.
- Measure response time, confirm shape consistency of all tensors.

---

###  `06_test_api_endpoints.py`
**Purpose**: End-to-end FastAPI test cases.

- Test `/upload` route for image ingestion and embedding storage.
- Test `/search/image` for image-to-image retrieval results.
- Test `/search/text` for text-to-image search accuracy.
- Test `/model/select` for model switching across trained checkpoints.
- Validate HTTP status codes, response schemas, and timings.
